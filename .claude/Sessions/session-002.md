# Session: ESLint Fixes and Critical Timezone Bug Resolution

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Tags:** bug-fix, eslint, typescript, timezone, calendar, deployment, vercel

## Objective

Fix multiple ESLint errors blocking deployment and resolve a critical timezone bug causing calendar events to display on incorrect days in the Vercel production environment.

## Summary

Successfully resolved all ESLint/TypeScript errors in the codebase and fixed a critical timezone bug that was causing calendar events to shift by one day when deployed to Vercel. The bug was caused by using `.toISOString().split('T')[0]` for date formatting, which converts to UTC and can shift dates. Replaced with timezone-safe local date formatting using `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, and `getDate()` methods across 4 files.

## Details

### ESLint Errors Fixed

Multiple ESLint and TypeScript errors were identified and resolved to enable successful deployment:

**Files Modified:**
- Various TypeScript type errors
- Unused variable warnings
- Code style issues

### Critical Timezone Bug

**Problem Description:**
Calendar events were displaying on the wrong days when viewed in the Vercel production environment. Events would appear one day earlier or later than intended.

**Root Cause:**
The codebase was using `.toISOString().split('T')[0]` to format dates, which:
1. Converts the date to UTC timezone
2. Can shift the date forward or backward depending on the local timezone
3. Causes inconsistent behavior between local development and production

**Example of the Bug:**
```javascript
// BUGGY CODE - converts to UTC and can shift dates
const dateStr = date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
// If local time is Oct 18, 2025 at 1:00 AM EST (UTC-4)
// toISOString() converts to: "2025-10-17T05:00:00.000Z"
// After split: "2025-10-17" (WRONG - shifted by 1 day!)
```

**Solution:**
Replaced with timezone-safe local date formatting:
```javascript
// FIXED CODE - uses local timezone
const year = date.getFullYear();
const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
const dateStr = `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
// Always gives the correct local date regardless of timezone
```

### Files Modified for Timezone Fix

1. **src/app/dashboard/calendar/page.tsx**
   - Fixed 3 separate locations where `.toISOString().split('T')[0]` was used
   - Location 1: Date formatting in the calendar grid
   - Location 2: Event date comparison logic
   - Location 3: Date selection handler

2. **src/app/api/chat/route.ts**
   - Fixed date formatting in the chat API endpoint
   - Ensures dates sent to/from the AI chat are in local timezone

3. **src/app/api/book-appointment/route.ts**
   - Fixed date formatting in appointment booking logic
   - Critical for ensuring appointments are booked on correct days

4. **src/app/api/calendar-chat/route.ts**
   - Fixed date formatting in calendar chat integration
   - Ensures chat-based calendar queries return correct dates

### Deployment Process

Multiple git commits and pushes were made throughout the session:
1. Initial ESLint error fixes
2. TypeScript type corrections
3. Timezone bug fixes (multiple iterations)
4. Verification and testing commits
5. Final deployment to Vercel

**Result:** All fixes successfully deployed to production on Vercel.

## Key Takeaways

- **Never use `.toISOString()` for date-only formatting**: This method converts to UTC and causes timezone-related bugs. Always use local date methods (`getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`) for date formatting.

- **Timezone bugs are subtle**: The bug only manifested in certain timezones and times of day, making it difficult to catch during development.

- **Local vs Production differences**: What works in local development may behave differently in production due to server timezone settings.

- **TypeScript strict mode helps**: Many of the ESLint errors caught potential runtime issues before they reached production.

## Impact

**Before:**
- Calendar events displayed on wrong days in production
- Users booking appointments saw incorrect available dates
- Data integrity issues with event storage
- Deployment blocked by ESLint errors

**After:**
- Calendar displays correct dates in all timezones
- Appointments book on intended dates
- Consistent behavior between development and production
- Clean deployment with no ESLint/TypeScript errors

## Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor production for any remaining timezone-related issues
- [ ] Consider adding timezone display to UI for transparency
- [ ] Review other areas of codebase for similar timezone bugs
- [ ] Add unit tests for date formatting functions
- [ ] Document the timezone handling approach in developer documentation
