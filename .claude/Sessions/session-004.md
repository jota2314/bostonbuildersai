**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Tags:** leads-dashboard, supabase, rls-policies, mobile-responsive, table-view, delete-functionality

## Objective

Fix leads deletion not persisting to database and enhance leads dashboard with mobile responsiveness, table view toggle, click-to-call/email buttons, quick status changes, and delete functionality.

## Summary

Enhanced the leads dashboard with comprehensive functionality improvements including click-to-call/email buttons, quick status dropdowns, table/card view toggle, full mobile optimization, and delete functionality. Identified and documented fix for RLS policy issue preventing lead deletion from persisting to database. Created migration file to add proper RLS DELETE policy for authenticated users.

## Details

### Issue: Delete Button Not Persisting

**User Report:**
"The delete button is not deleting from the database. After I refresh, it comes back."

**Root Cause:**
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on the `leads` table
- Missing DELETE policy for authenticated users
- Delete operation silently fails due to insufficient permissions
- UI updates optimistically but database deletion is blocked

**Solution:**
Created migration file: `supabase/migrations/add_leads_rls_policies.sql`

**Migration Contents:**
```sql
-- Enable Row Level Security on leads table
ALTER TABLE leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies (to avoid conflicts)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all access for service role" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own leads" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own leads" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own leads" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own leads" ON leads;

-- Service role full access (for API routes)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for service role" ON leads
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Authenticated users can view their own leads
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own leads" ON leads
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text);

-- Authenticated users can insert their own leads
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own leads" ON leads
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text);

-- Authenticated users can update their own leads
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own leads" ON leads
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text);

-- Authenticated users can delete their own leads (MISSING POLICY)
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own leads" ON leads
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id::text);
```

**How to Apply:**
1. **Supabase Dashboard:** SQL Editor → Run migration SQL
2. **Supabase MCP:** (To be configured in next session)

### Leads Dashboard Enhancements

**User Requirements:**
1. Click-to-call and click-to-email buttons
2. Quick status change dropdown
3. Table view option alongside card view
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Desktop optimization with scrolling
6. Delete lead functionality with confirmation

**Implementation:**

#### 1. Click-to-Call & Click-to-Email
```tsx
// Email button
<a
  href={`mailto:${lead.email}`}
  className="flex items-center gap-1 px-3 py-2 bg-blue-500/10 hover:bg-blue-500/20 text-blue-400 rounded transition-colors"
  title={`Email ${lead.email}`}
>
  <Mail className="w-4 h-4" />
  <span className="text-sm">Email</span>
</a>

// Call button
<a
  href={`tel:${lead.phone}`}
  className="flex items-center gap-1 px-3 py-2 bg-green-500/10 hover:bg-green-500/20 text-green-400 rounded transition-colors"
  title={`Call ${lead.phone}`}
>
  <Phone className="w-4 h-4" />
  <span className="text-sm">Call</span>
</a>
```

#### 2. Quick Status Change Dropdown
```tsx
const handleStatusChange = async (leadId: string, newStatus: string) => {
  try {
    await updateLead(leadId, { status: newStatus as any });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update lead status:', error);
    alert('Failed to update status. Please try again.');
  }
};

<select
  value={lead.status}
  onChange={(e) => handleStatusChange(lead.id, e.target.value)}
  className="text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded bg-slate-700 border border-slate-600"
>
  {Object.entries(statusConfig).map(([key, config]) => (
    <option key={key} value={key}>{config.label}</option>
  ))}
</select>
```

#### 3. Table/Card View Toggle
```tsx
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'cards' | 'table'>('cards');

// Toggle buttons
<div className="flex gap-2 bg-slate-800 rounded-lg p-1">
  <button
    onClick={() => setViewMode('cards')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors ${
      viewMode === 'cards'
        ? 'bg-primary text-white'
        : 'text-slate-400 hover:text-white'
    }`}
  >
    Cards
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => setViewMode('table')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-md transition-colors ${
      viewMode === 'table'
        ? 'bg-primary text-white'
        : 'text-slate-400 hover:text-white'
    }`}
  >
    Table
  </button>
</div>
```

#### 4. Mobile Responsiveness

**Stats Grid:**
```tsx
// 2-column grid on mobile, 4-column on desktop
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-3 md:gap-4">
```

**Card Grid:**
```tsx
// 1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-4 md:gap-6">
```

**Tap Targets:**
- All buttons minimum 40px height for mobile touch
- Action buttons always visible on mobile (no hover requirement)
```tsx
// Mobile: always visible, Desktop: show on hover
<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 opacity-100 md:opacity-0 md:group-hover:opacity-100">
```

**Text Truncation:**
```tsx
<h3 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-bold text-white truncate">
  {lead.company_name}
</h3>
```

**Responsive Font Sizes:**
```tsx
className="text-xs md:text-sm"
className="text-sm md:text-base"
className="text-lg md:text-xl"
```

#### 5. Desktop Optimization

**Max Width & Scrolling:**
```tsx
// Increased max width for large screens
<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto"> {/* Changed from max-w-6xl */}

// Custom scrollbar styling
<div className="overflow-x-auto custom-scrollbar">
  <style jsx>{`
    .custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {
      height: 8px;
    }
    .custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
      background: #1e293b;
    }
    .custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
      background: #475569;
      border-radius: 4px;
    }
  `}</style>
</div>
```

**Scroll Indicators:**
```tsx
<div className="text-xs text-slate-400 mb-2 text-right">
  Scroll horizontally to see all columns →
</div>
```

**Table Width:**
```tsx
<table className="w-full min-w-[1000px]">
```

#### 6. Delete Functionality

```tsx
const handleDeleteLead = async (leadId: string, leadName: string) => {
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    `Are you sure you want to delete ${leadName}? This action cannot be undone.`
  );

  if (confirmed) {
    try {
      await deleteLead(leadId);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to delete lead:', error);
      alert('Failed to delete lead. Please try again.');
    }
  }
};

// Delete button in card view
<button
  onClick={() => handleDeleteLead(lead.id, lead.company_name)}
  className="p-2 bg-red-500/10 hover:bg-red-500/20 text-red-400 rounded transition-colors"
  title="Delete lead"
>
  <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4" />
</button>

// Delete button in table view
<button
  onClick={() => handleDeleteLead(lead.id, lead.company_name)}
  className="w-10 h-10 flex items-center justify-center bg-red-500/10 hover:bg-red-500/20 text-red-400 rounded transition-colors"
  title="Delete lead"
>
  <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4" />
</button>
```

## Known Issues

### RLS Policy Blocker
**Issue:** Delete operations don't persist to database
**Status:** ⏳ Pending RLS policy application
**Fix Available:** Migration file created
**Next Step:** Apply migration via Supabase Dashboard or MCP

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Install Supabase MCP**
   - Configure MCP server for Supabase
   - Enable direct database interaction from Claude Code

2. **Apply RLS Policies**
   - Run migration: `supabase/migrations/add_leads_rls_policies.sql`
   - Verify DELETE policy is active
   - Test lead deletion persists after refresh

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add bulk delete functionality
- [ ] Add export to CSV/Excel
- [ ] Add lead assignment to team members
- [ ] Add activity timeline for each lead
- [ ] Add email/call tracking integration
- [ ] Add lead scoring system
- [ ] Add pipeline visualization (Kanban board)

## Code Flow

**Delete Lead Flow (Current - Failing at DB):**
```
1. User clicks delete button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms
4. handleDeleteLead() calls deleteLead(leadId)
5. Zustand store calls Supabase .delete()
6. ❌ Supabase RLS blocks DELETE (missing policy)
7. UI updates optimistically (removes from state)
8. Refresh → Lead reappears (DB still has it)
```

**Delete Lead Flow (After Fix):**
```
1. User clicks delete button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms
4. handleDeleteLead() calls deleteLead(leadId)
5. Zustand store calls Supabase .delete()
6. ✅ RLS allows DELETE (policy: user owns lead)
7. Database deletes the row
8. UI updates (removes from state)
9. Refresh → Lead stays deleted (permanent)
```

## Debugging Commands

**Check Supabase Policies (SQL Editor):**
```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'leads';
```

**Test Delete Permission:**
```sql
-- Run as authenticated user (not service role)
DELETE FROM leads WHERE id = 'test-lead-id';
-- Should succeed after policy is applied
```
