# AI Voice Calling - Deployment Checklist

Follow these steps in order to deploy your AI voice calling system with Cloudflare!

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- [ ] Cloudflare account (free) - [Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- [ ] OpenAI API key with Realtime API access
- [ ] Twilio account with phone number
- [ ] Supabase database (already set up ‚úÖ)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Install Wrangler CLI

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

- [ ] Wrangler installed

### Step 2: Login to Cloudflare

```bash
wrangler login
```

- [ ] Logged in to Cloudflare

### Step 3: Generate API Secret Key

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Maximum 256 }))
```

- [ ] API secret generated
- [ ] Secret copied to clipboard

### Step 4: Update Next.js Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
API_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_FROM_STEP_3
CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL=wss://boston-builders-voice-ai.YOUR-NAME.workers.dev
```

- [ ] `API_SECRET_KEY` added to `.env.local`
- [ ] File saved

### Step 5: Deploy Cloudflare Worker

```bash
cd cloudflare-voice-worker
npm install
```

Set secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
# Paste your OpenAI API key

wrangler secret put USER_ID
# Paste your Supabase user_id from .env.local

wrangler secret put NEXT_JS_API_URL
# Enter: https://your-app.vercel.app (your deployed URL)

wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY
# Paste the secret from Step 3
```

Deploy:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

- [ ] Worker deployed
- [ ] Worker URL copied (e.g., `https://boston-builders-voice-ai.YOUR-NAME.workers.dev`)

### Step 6: Update Worker URL in Code

Edit `src/app/api/initiate-call/route.ts` line 35:

Replace:
```typescript
const wsUrl = process.env.CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL || 'wss://boston-builders-voice-ai.YOUR-NAME.workers.dev';
```

With your actual Worker URL from Step 5.

Or add to `.env.local`:
```env
CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL=wss://your-actual-worker-url.workers.dev
```

- [ ] Worker URL updated

### Step 7: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add AI voice calling with Cloudflare"
git push
```

- [ ] Pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel auto-deployed
- [ ] Environment variables synced in Vercel dashboard

### Step 8: Test!

1. Go to your landing page
2. Fill out the lead form
3. Use YOUR phone number for testing
4. Submit
5. Wait for call (should be immediate!)
